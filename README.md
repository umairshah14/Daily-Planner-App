# Daily Planner

## Description
I created this repository to hold my submission for the week7 challenge which was to create a Workday Scheduler which presents all the hours of a working day from 9 to 5 and then allows the user to input text into each time slot and save it in order to keep a schedule of their tasks. Depending on the time of day, the slots will either appear as grey, red or green indicating that the timeslot has either passed, is the current hour you're in right now or that the hour is in the future.

This task helped me understand how to properly use jquery to grab elements from CSS and HTML without having to use vanilla JavaScript features such as getElementById. I also learnt quite a lot about Moment.js and how it can be used to display information according to time

Below is a screenshot of what the project should look like when opened in the browser
